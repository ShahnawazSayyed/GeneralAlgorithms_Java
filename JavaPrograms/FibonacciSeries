/*Given a number ‘n’, the task is to print the Fibonacci series using Scanner Function. 
The Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following integer sequence.

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ……..

In mathematical terms, the sequence Fn of Fibonacci numbers is defined by the recurrence relation 
    Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2
	with seed values
   F0 = 0 and F1 = 1.
